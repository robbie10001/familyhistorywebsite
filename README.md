FAMILY HISTORY WEBSITE  

Purpose of the Website

I have done a lot of research into my family history. I would like to make a website that my extented family (especially those in England) can use for researching the family. It will also allow me to work on my web development skills and help me to solitify what i have learnt during our lessons on HTML and CSS. 

Tech Stack

I will employ CSS and HTML through the use of SASS. I will also try and add some JAVA script minimally to the site, to gain some knowledge of this programming language. Ruby on Rails will also be used to create a sign up page and an emailing list for those who are interested in the site.
