Introduction

I have done heaps of research into my family. I had planned to write a book, but in the short term i think that building a website might be of more use. 

Pages 

Currently, my plan is to have 
1. A home page
2. A family origins page
3. Important place page
4. Important family members page 
5. Geneology page for each generation 

1. Home page

The home page will introduce people to the site, state it's purpose and welcome people to the page. It will have some photos of ancestors and the like. It will feature a locked top nav bar for ease of navigation on either mobile or desktop and will have internal links to the other sections of the website.

2. A family origins page

I will talk about the oldest records that exist for the family. 
Introduce laycock(lacock). 
Talk about the eldest records from the parish church. 
Mention churchwarders and issac colborne 1640 sentencing 
Talk about what the family did and how they became established. 

3. Important Places Page 

On this page i will talk about the Colborne's who are listed in memorials at Lacock Church. I will about the houses that the family had. I will talk about the move to Chippenham and the family members who became mayors of the town. I will talk about Hardenhuish house and St Nicholas Church. 

4. Important Family Members 

- Sir John Colborne 
- Baron Colborne of West Hardling 
- Viscount Ridley 
- William Colborne (mayor)
- Joseph Colborne (mayor)
- Joseph Colborne son of first mayor and mayor himself 
- William Henry Colborne (MD) probable mayor of 1869 
- Thomas Colborne (monmothshire)

5. Geneology page for each generation

5.1 William Henry 1822-1869
5.2 Wiliam 1785-1868
5.3 Wiliam 1755-1793
5.4 Robert 1709-1766
5.5 Henry 1679-1733 
5.6 Thomas 1646-1700
5.7 Robert 1617-1678?
and so on until 1480. 

The other pages should link to the Geneology section of the website which will then be self-contained. I think this is the best way to organise it.
